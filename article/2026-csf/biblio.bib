abstract = {Linear type systems have a long and storied history, but not a clear path forward
to integrate with existing languages such as OCaml or Haskell. In this paper, we study
a linear type system designed with two crucial properties in mind: backwards-compatibility
and code reuse across linear and non-linear users of a library. Only then can the
benefits of linear types permeate conventional functional programming. Rather than
bifurcate types into linear and non-linear counterparts, we instead attach linearity
to function arrows. Linear functions can receive inputs from linearly-bound values,
but can also operate over unrestricted, regular values. To demonstrate the efficacy
of our linear type system&nbsp;—&nbsp;both how easy it can be integrated in an existing language
implementation and how streamlined it makes it to write programs with linear types&nbsp;—&nbsp;we
implemented our type system in ghc, the leading Haskell compiler, and demonstrate
two kinds of applications of linear types: mutable data with pure interfaces; and
enforcing protocols in I/O-performing functions.},

abstract = {From the Publisher:Mobile systems, whose components communicate and change their structure,
now pervade the informational world and the wider world of which it is a part. The
science of mobile systems is as yet immature, however. This book presents the pi-calculus,
a theory of mobile systems. The pi-calculus provides a conceptual framework for understanding
mobility, and mathematical tools for expressing systems and reasoning about their
behaviors. The book serves both as a reference for the theory and as an extended demonstration
of how to use pi-calculus to describe systems and analyze their properties. It covers
the basic theory of pi-calculus, typed pi-calculi, higher-order processes, the relationship
between pi-calculus and lambda-calculus, and applications of pi-calculus to object-oriented
design and programming. The book is written at the graduate level, assuming no prior
acquaintance with the subject, and is intended for computer scientists interested
in mobile systems.}

The framework is based on two ideas: a subset of the logic CTL for which satisfaction
is preserved under composition, and a preorder on structures which captures the relation
between a component and a system containing the component. Satisfaction of a formula
in the logic corresponds to being below a particular structure (a tableau for the
formula) in the preorder. We show how to do assume-guarantee-style reasoning within
this framework. Additionally, we demonstrate efficient methods for model checking
in the logic and for checking the preorder in several special cases. We have implemented
a system based on these methods, and we use it to give a compositional verification
of a CPU controller.},

abstract = {A program denotes computations in some universe of objects. Abstract interpretation
of programs consists in using that denotation to describe computations in another
universe of abstract objects, so that the results of abstract execution give some
information on the actual computations. An intuitive example (which we borrow from
Sintzoff [72]) is the rule of signs. The text -1515 * 17 may be understood to denote
computations on the abstract universe {(+), (-), (±)} where the semantics of arithmetic
operators is defined by the rule of signs. The abstract execution -1515 * 17 → -(+)
* (+) → (-) * (+) → (-), proves that -1515 * 17 is a negative number. Abstract interpretation
is concerned by a particular underlying structure of the usual universe of computations
(the sign, in our example). It gives a summary of some facets of the actual executions
of a program. In general this summary is simple to obtain but inaccurate (e.g. -1515
+ 17 → -(+) + (+) → (-) + (+) → (±)). Despite its fundamentally incomplete results
abstract interpretation allows the programmer or the compiler to answer questions
which do not need full knowledge of program executions or which tolerate an imprecise
answer, (e.g. partial correctness proofs of programs ignoring the termination problems,
type checking, program optimizations which are not carried in the absence of certainty
about their feasibility, …).},

abstract="The Move Prover (MVP) is a formal verifier for smart contracts written in the Move programming language. MVP has an expressive specification language, and is fast and reliable enough that it can be run routinely by developers and in integration testing. Besides the simplicity of smart contracts and the Move language, three implementation approaches are responsible for the practicality of MVP: (1) an alias-free memory model, (2) fine-grained invariant checking, and (3) monomorphization. The entirety of the Move code for the Diem blockchain has been extensively specified and can be completely verified by MVP in a few minutes. Changes in the Diem framework must be successfully verified before being integrated into the open source repository on GitHub.",
